	    Mission of the Oncogenomics Section<br>

	    The mission of the Oncogenomics Section is to harness the power of high throughput genomic and proteomic methods to improve the outcome of children with high-risk metastatic, refractory and recurrent cancers. The research goals are to integrate the data, decipher the biology of these cancers and to identify and validate biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets and to rapidly translate our findings to the clinic. For more information about our research, visit the Oncogenomics Section website.<br><br>

	    <b>1. Comprehensive Omics Analysis:</b> 
	    a) Applying high-throughput genomics, proteomics mathematical modeling and bioinformatics to characterize currently incurable malignancies including metastatic, resistant and relapsed tumors for the identification and validation of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. b) Genome wide association studies and mutational screening of germ-line DNA.<br><br>

	    <b>2. Targeted Therapeutics: </b>
	    a) High-throughput siRNA, small molecule, natural products, and drug screening for high-risk pediatric malignancies. b) Development of molecularly targeted therapeutic agents against existing and newly identified targets.<br><br>

	    <b>3. Translational Oncology:</b> 
	    Leverage the existing clinical and scientific strengths within the Genetics Branch including phase 1/2 therapeutics, immune/vaccine therapy and molecular biology to translate these findings to the clinic in an environment where there is state-of-the-art clinical care.<br><br>

	    Scientific Focus Areas:<br>
	    Cell Biology, Computational Biology, Genetics and Genomics, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Systems Biology<br>
